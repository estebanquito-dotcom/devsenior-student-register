# Product Management System - Module 1 📦

Welcome! This is my first integrative project for the Java programming course. It is a console-based application designed to manage basic product information by applying the fundamentals of structured programming.

## Features

The system allows users to perform the following actions through an interactive menu:

* **Product Registration:** Capture name, unit price, and stock levels with real-time validation.
* **Data Management:** View current product details or clear existing records.
* **Automatic Calculations:** Automatically calculates the total inventory value based on price and quantity.
* **Stock Analysis:** Classifies inventory into three levels: *Low Stock*, *Sufficient Stock*, or *High Stock*.
* **Robust Validation:** The system ensures data integrity by rejecting negative prices, invalid quantities, or empty names.

## Key Learnings

During the development of this project, I implemented core Java concepts that form the foundation of software development:

1.  **Control Structures:** Utilized `while` loops for the main program flow and `switch/if-else` statements for decision-making logic.
2.  **Modularization (Methods):** Focused on "Clean Code" principles by breaking down the problem into independent, reusable methods to improve readability.
3.  **Static Variables:** Used `static` keywords to manage data persistence throughout the application's lifecycle.
4.  **Data Validation:** Developed logic to sanitize user input and prevent runtime errors.
5.  **I/O Handling:** Mastered the `Scanner` class for user input and `System.out.printf` for professional numerical formatting (two decimal places).

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java (JDK 17+)
* **Tools:** Command Line Interface (CLI)

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the project in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse).
3.  Compile and run the main class.
4.  Follow the on-screen menu instructions in the console.
